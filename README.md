AutoExportModelPlugin
=====================

This is a Cura plugin that causes the current model displayed in the scene to be saved as an OBJ
file whenever G-code is sent to a device. Cura designates saving to a file or removable media as
sending to a device so those actions will also cause the OBJ file to be written.

The OBJ format was chosen since Cura has a built-in mesh writer for the format and it is an
extremely common and easy-to-use format. A JS-based visualizer for OBJ files is quite simple to
write and many exist. The g-code data itself is not written since it has significantly more data
in it that would be hard to deal with to make sure the display is a "clean" model without all of
the support, travels, and other actions it describes.
